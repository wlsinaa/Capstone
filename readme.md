# Math 4993 Capstone Project (Statistics)

This is a project-based course that provides students an opportunity to integrate and apply their statistical knowledge to analyzing data.

All programs are written in SAS language

## Introduction (Project 1)
Multiple linear regression is applied for predicting the age of abalone. It was found that multicollinearity between 
predictors, which makes the prediction more difficulty. Initially, ridge regression is used.Model selection using LASSO is applied in the 
model.

## Introduction (Project 2) 
Contraceptive methods are important in control of population. In this research, 
logistic regression and multinomial logit model are used to evaluate how the women used 
contraceptive method. It is found that younger women with low education background and 
Islamic women has higher chance to preders no use of methods.
